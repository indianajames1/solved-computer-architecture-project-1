Note: MARS does not have a graphics capability so character-based display is sufficient.

As discussed, you can work with another student, so if you choose that option you should find a partner and start working on the project as soon as possible.

 <li><strong>Submission Requirements:</strong></li>

</ul>

At the end of the semester, EACH student must submit a ZIP file containing
